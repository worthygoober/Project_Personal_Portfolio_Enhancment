            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>I have bounced from career to career, always in search of that right fit.
                I have worked as a college Admission Counselor, Middle & High School Science Teacher, Retail bookseller, Molecular Lab Technician, Warehouse Manager, and Professional Umpire/Referee.</p>
            <p>Nothing has fit quite like coding and web development. I couldn't be more excited to be on this journey and to have finally found something that calls to me the way coding does.</p>
